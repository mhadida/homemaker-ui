# Homemaker UI

Interactive parametric building editor. Users draw a building footprint on a map, configure parameters, and Blender generates an IFC model.

## Architecture

Four parts work together:

- **`homemaker-ui/`** (this repo) — Next.js 16 app, the interactive editor. Generates IFC + glTF in pure Python (`ifcopenshell` + `topologic_core` + Molior) — no Blender needed in the deployed web app.
- **`python/vendor/homemaker-addon/`** — Bruno Postle's Blender addon, vendored as a Git submodule pinned to a known-good commit. Provides the Molior IFC generator.
- **`../homemaker-blender/`** (sibling repo, optional) — developer tooling: MCP server + Blender workspace for driving a running Blender instance from agents like Claude Code. Not required for the web app.
- **Blender** (optional, dev-only) — runs Bonsai + Homemaker addons when you want to use the MCP bridge.

## Commands

| What | Command | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Dev server | `npm run dev` | Next.js dev server on :3000 |
| Build | `npm run build` | |
| Start prod | `npm run start` | |
| Lint | `npm run lint` | ESLint 9 flat config (`eslint.config.mjs`) |
| Typecheck | `npx tsc --noEmit` | No npm script exists — run manually |
| MCP server (dev only) | `uv run ../homemaker-blender/mcp_server.py` | Bridges agents to a running Blender; lives in the sibling repo |
| Tests | `npm test` | vitest — src/lib/facade + src/lib/street unit tests |

**Tests:** vitest covers the pure facade modules — layout engine (incl. section strips), prompt parser, street generator (`refit`/`deleteLot`), node welding, corner detection/sync/miters, section edit helpers, street-aware orientation, and marquee hit-test/delete/translate (`src/lib/facade/*.test.ts`) — plus the standalone street-network module: centreline smoothing, ribbon offsets, roundabout rings, derived intersections, and the Krier/Alexander advisory (`src/lib/street/*.test.ts`) — run `npm test`. No e2e/playwright; everything else is verified visually.

## Blender is NOT a runtime dependency of the web app

The deployed web app (Vercel + the local `npm run dev` flow) generates IFC and glTF purely in Python via Molior + `ifcopenshell` + `topologic_core`. The pipeline entry is `python/generate.py:build_and_export_glb()`.

Blender is **optional dev tooling**, only used if you want to drive a running Blender instance from an MCP-connected agent. That flow lives in the sibling [`homemaker-blender`](../homemaker-blender/) repo (private). When using it, Blender must run with Bonsai + the Homemaker addon enabled and the BlenderMCP socket server listening on `127.0.0.1:9876`.

The startup sequence matters: Bonsai first, then Homemaker. The autostart script handles this: `~/Library/Application Support/Blender/4.3/scripts/startup/homemaker_autostart.py`

## Facade designer (`/facade`)

A single-wall parametric facade designer for infill urban lots (one street-facing
facade, party walls both sides). Pure client-side Three.js — the Python pipeline is
NOT involved; every edit is live (no Update button). Spec:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-06-facade-designer-design.md`.

- **Layout engine**: `src/lib/facade/layout.ts` is a pure function
  (FacadeParams → rectangles) holding ALL validity clamps; the mesh renders
  whatever it returns.
- **Grid model**: (storeys × bays) cells, treatment-derived defaults + sparse
  `cellOverrides` patches.
- **Quad workspace**: plan / perspective / elevation overview / detail as
  drei `<View>` viewports over one Canvas (`FacadeViewer.tsx`); elevation
  cameras always aim along the facade normal (`src/lib/facade/camera.ts`).
- **Blocks & streets**: pen-tool drawing in the plan pane — click chains
  nodes into welded segments (Escape ends, clicking the first node closes
  the loop); every segment is a generated block (`src/lib/facade/blocks.ts`
  + `generate.ts`). Nodes are derived from exactly-equal endpoints
  (`nodes.ts`); dragging one re-fits every attached block (`refit` in
  `generate.ts` — absorb at the moved end, split at lotWidth.max+min,
  remove below min). Width edits ripple through welds the same way. Hand
  edits pin lots against reroll.
- **Corner buildings**: welded two-block junctions turning ≤ the global max
  angle merge into one building (`src/lib/facade/corners.ts`): shells
  (storeys/colors/ornament/glazing) sync through the `syncCorners` choke
  point on every mutation; walls miter so cornice/parapet run continuously;
  corner nodes tint gold and a stationary click opens the corner inspector
  (unified ↔ 2-facades, primary side, global angle).
- **Sections**: one lot's facade divides into vertical strips of whole bays
  with ±15 cm perpendicular relief (`FacadeParams.sections`, sparse — absent
  means one flush strip). `resolveSections` in `layout.ts` holds all clamps
  (proportional refit of stale partitions, live symmetry enforcement);
  `sections.ts` holds the canonical edit helpers + AI patterns; cornice/
  parapet step with the offsets; `syncCorners` flattens corner-side end
  sections so miters stay closed. Spec:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-14-facade-sections-design.md`.
- **Massing**: each building gets a body — one wall-colored box per section
  strip behind the facade, front flush with the wall back, extending back
  by a per-lot `massingDepth` (clamped 3–20 m in `layout.ts`, default 8, a
  panel Depth slider). Flat-topped; roofs cap it. Spec:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-14-massing-design.md`.
- **Roofs**: flat / gable / hip, ridge parallel or perpendicular to street,
  per-lot height (`src/lib/facade/roof.ts`, pure — `resolveRoof` → clamped
  `RoofPlan`, `roofTriangles` → soup the mesh auto-orients by normal).
  Default flat (no mesh); generator seeds variety; `roofType`+`roofHeight`
  and `roofColor` (slate/red) are corner shell fields (orientation stays per-wing). Corner hip-valley
  merge deferred. Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-14-roofs-design.md`.
- **Topography + basements**: a global tilted ground (`ground: {slope,
  azimuth}` page state; `src/lib/facade/terrain.ts` pure — `groundHeightAt`,
  `levelingFor`, `groundNormal`). Each building levels its floor to the
  front-centre ground height and grows a stone basement (thin horizontal
  windows) down to the lowest footprint corner; the ground plane + grid
  tilt to the slope. `slope 0` = flat = byte-identical. Per-node/heightfield
  "arbitrary" topography deferred. Spec:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-14-topography-design.md`.
- **Street awareness**: a centreline + mirror (far-frontage) derive live from
  the first block's facade normal (`src/lib/facade/street.ts` pure —
  `streetRefOf`, `streetLines`, `streetAwareFlipped`; width a page-state
  slider, default 14 m). New blocks drawn inside the street corridor
  auto-orient their facade toward the centreline (fixes "inside-out"
  drawing). Facing is a **chain-level** decision so a block's side never
  flips between welded segments: the pen locks the street-aware orientation
  at the chain's first segment and reuses it for every later segment; `f`
  flips the whole chain (persistent + retroactively flips already-committed
  segments via `onFlipChain`, same op as the "Flip side" button). A live
  green tick previews the facing. The first block (no reference yet) is
  oriented by `f` alone and then defines the street. Guides render in the
  plan pane only; orientation applies on creation only. Spec:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-14-street-awareness-design.md`.
- **Dormers**: `FacadeParams.dormers` (0..bays, clamped) adds gabled dormer
  windows to the street-facing slope of a **parallel** pitched roof so it reads
  as an occupied storey (Nyhavn). Pure `roofDormers(plan, count)` in `roof.ts`
  (front-slope placements, empty for flat/perpendicular/too-shallow);
  `layout.roofDormers`; `DormerMesh` in `FacadeMesh.tsx` (window + cheeks + a
  little gable roof + cheeks that die into the opaque main slope at the back —
  watertight, no poke-through). `dormers` is a corner **shell** field (both
  wings match). Slider under Roof (parallel only). Absent/0 = byte-identical.
  Extends `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-14-roofs-design.md`.
- **Shaped gables**: `FacadeParams.gableStyle` (`curved` Dutch ogee /
  `stepped` crow-step) rises the street wall above the eave into an ornamental
  silhouette (`src/lib/facade/gable.ts` pure — `gableProfile(style, width,
  rise)` → symmetric outline points, sampled béziers / crow-steps);
  `layout.gable: GablePlan`; `GableMesh` extrudes the profile to a wall panel
  + a trim coping `<Line>`. `gableHeight` clamped `[GABLE_HEIGHT_MIN,MAX]`.
  Gable style + height are corner **shell** fields. Section under Roof. Absent
  = byte-identical. Spec:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-14-shaped-gables-design.md`.
- **Pass-through arch**: a ground-floor treatment `"passage"` — a tall
  semicircular carriage arch at the door bay that pierces the massing box so
  you see through to behind (`src/lib/facade/layout.ts` — `resolveGrid` maps
  the door bay to `"passage"`; the opening is arched (`OpeningRect.arched`,
  head radius w/2, width shrinks on short storeys to keep a `PASSAGE_MIN_SIDE`
  jamb); `computeLayout` exposes `layout.passage: PassagePlan` — the tunnel
  void — only for a ground-storey passage). `FacadeMesh.buildStripGeometry`
  punches an arched wall hole; `StripMass` splits the strip's box into piers +
  lintel around the full-depth void (+ dark cobble floor); `PassageFill` adds a
  keystone + imposts. Toggle in the treatment row; AI/local prompt know
  passage/tunnel/carriage-arch/porte-cochère. Absent = byte-identical (single
  box, rectangular holes). Spec:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-14-passage-arch-design.md`.
- **Save / Load**: the whole scene is a JSON-native object graph, so
  persistence is a versioned `FacadeDocument` (`src/lib/facade/document.ts`
  pure — `serializeScene`/`toJSON`, `deserializeScene`/`fromJSON`;
  `cornerChoices` Map ⇄ entries; `deserializeScene` validates version + block
  shape and defaults missing scalars, never throws). Header **Save** downloads
  `facade-scene.json`, **Load** imports one; a debounced localStorage autosave
  (`facademaker:autosave`) restores the scene on refresh. `reserveBlockIds`
  (blocks.ts) bumps the session id counter past loaded ids so drawn blocks
  never collide. No backend. Spec:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-14-save-load-design.md`.
- **AI prompt**: `/api/facade-prompt` (flat fully-required zod spec — OpenAI
  structured output rejects optionals) targets the selected lot, plus an
  instant local keyword parser.
- **Marquee selection**: a Select tool (toggle beside Draw, mutually
  exclusive) turns a plan-pane left-drag into a rubber-band rectangle that
  grabs a **unified, mixed** set — blocks, lots, and nodes at once
  (`src/lib/facade/marquee.ts` pure — `hitTest` holds the enclosure rule:
  a block when BOTH endpoints are enclosed → whole-block op; else a lot when
  its center is inside, and a node when it's inside and not an endpoint of a
  fully-enclosed block, which subsumes its own lots/nodes). Dragging inside
  the selection bbox translates it live (`translateMarquee` — rigid shift of
  enclosed blocks + `moveNode` ripple for loose nodes); the Selection panel
  (`MarqueeControls` in `FacadeControls.tsx`) deletes (`deleteMarquee`, split-
  safe multi-lot removal), rerolls (`affectedBlockIds`), or bulk-restyles
  every selected lot. `⌘/Ctrl+A` selects every block (whole-block marquee);
  a single-lot click clears the marquee (the two selection models are mutually
  exclusive both ways). Every mutation funnels through `syncCorners`; `marquee`
  defaults null + the tool defaults off so the unused feature is byte-
  identical. Node-merge (welding selected nodes) is deferred — nodes move
  only. Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-14-marquee-selection-design.md`.
- **Street Network**: a standalone, drawable, typed road network —
  `alley`/`street`/`road`/`boulevard` (`src/lib/street/types.ts` — `Street`,
  `StreetType`, `STREET_SPECS` widths/car flags, `Monument`,
  `StreetNetwork`). Polylines render as paved ribbons whose corners round to a
  per-type minimum curve radius (`STREET_SPECS[type].minRadius` — boulevards
  sweep wide, alleys turn tight) via `filletCentreline`/`cornerFit` (real
  tangent+arc road alignment, endpoints pinned so junctions are unaffected) +
  `streetRibbon` in `src/lib/street/geometry.ts`; `StreetRibbonMesh` in
  `src/components/street/`. The whole network **drapes on the tilted ground**
  (`groundHeightAt` per ribbon vertex; the roundabout disc tilts to the ground
  plane; monuments stand plumb) — flat ground is byte-identical.
  (`smoothCentreline` is retained but superseded by the fillet.)
  Shared-endpoint junctions
  are derived, not stored (`intersections.ts` — `deriveIntersections`) and
  any junction can become a roundabout + monument (obelisk/fountain), written
  sparsely into `network.roundabouts` (`roundaboutRing` in `geometry.ts`;
  `RoundaboutMesh`/`MonumentMesh` in `src/components/street/`). A **Roads**
  draw tool (mutually exclusive with
  the block pen and Select) places polyline vertices with a type selector;
  clicking a ribbon or an intersection marker opens the **Street** /
  **Intersection** inspector in `FacadeControls.tsx` (type, width override,
  delete; roundabout on/off + monument pick) — page state `streetNetwork`,
  `selectedStreet`, `selectedIntersection`. A pure, non-blocking Krier/
  Alexander advisory (`geometry.ts` — `streetAdvisory`) hints at an
  uninterrupted straight alley/street run, an overlong boulevard, or a corner
  drawn tighter than the type's minimum radius; it never blocks the layout. The network **coexists** with the existing block/lot/
  corner system — additive, no shared state (Save/Load extends the document;
  an empty network is byte-identical). Block/plot/building derivation from
  the network, mid-span crossings, and open-square plazas are deferred to
  later sub-projects. Specs:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-15-street-network-design.md` (network) +
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-16-street-realism-design.md` (SP-2a:
  radius-limited fillet + topography draping).

## Tailwind v4

Uses `@import "tailwindcss"` in `globals.css` (not old `@tailwind` directives). PostCSS plugin is `@tailwindcss/postcss` v4. No `tailwind.config.*` file.

## Path alias

`@/*` → `./src/*` (configured in both `tsconfig.json` and `next.config.ts`).

## Engine docs (key references)

- `docs/engine-variables.md` — All Homemaker parameters, style system, room types, topology conditions, IFC property sets
- `docs/engine-dependencies.md` — Dependency chain, setup requirements, the Bonsai pip-conflict gotcha

Available styles: `default`, `blank`, `cinema`, `courtyard`, `fancy`, `foxhouse`, `framing`, `halifax` (with sub-styles `arcade`, `rustic`, `tuscan`), `nonplanar`, `simple`.

Room types: `bedroom`, `circulation`, `circulation_stair`, `stair`, `kitchen`, `living`, `outside`, `retail`, `sahn`, `toilet`, `void`.

## MCP integration

- `.mcp.json` (gitignored, per-developer) registers `mcp_server.py` from the sibling `../homemaker-blender/` repo as a Homemaker MCP tool. Copy `.mcp.json.example` to `.mcp.json` to enable.
- `.claude/settings.local.json` pre-approves a subset of MCP tools (`execute_python`, `clear_scene`, `create_building_mesh`, `render_view`, `select_objects`, `homemaker`).
- To use manually: `claude mcp add homemaker -- uv run ../homemaker-blender/mcp_server.py`

## The app is dark-only

Hardcoded dark mode in `layout.tsx` (`className="dark"`). CSS uses custom properties (`--background`, `--foreground`, `--panel-bg`, `--border`, `--accent`, `--muted`). No light theme support.
